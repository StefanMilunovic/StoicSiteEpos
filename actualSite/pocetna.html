            <p>For those of us who live our lives in the real world, there is one branch of philosophy created just for us: Stoicism. </p>
            <p>   It’s a philosophy designed to make us more resilient, happier, more virtuous and more wise–and as a result, better people, better parents and better professionals. </p>
            <p>    Stoicism has been a common thread though some of history’s great leaders. 
                It has been practiced by Kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs. 
                Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Frederick the Great, Montaigne, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Theodore Roosevelt, General James Mattis, —just to name a few—were all influenced by Stoic philosophy.

            <h2>“Memento Mori”: The Reminder We All Desperately Need</h2>
            <h5>Dec 8, 2020.</h5>

            <div class="card">
                <img style="max-width: 1024px; max-height: 768px;" src="../actualSite/img/memento.jpg" alt="Marcus">
            
        
            <p>
                At a Roman triumph, the majority of the public would have their eyes glued to the victorious general at the front—one of the most coveted spots during Roman times. Only a few would notice the aide in the back, right behind the commander, whispering into his ear, “Remember, thou art mortal.” What a reminder to hear at the peak of glory and victory!
            </p>
            <p>
                It is reminders like this one that we desperately need in our own lives—a thought or an idea that we’d rather ignore, do everything to avoid and pretend is not true. Most often, our ego runs away from anything that reminds us of the reality that sits at odds with the comfortable narrative we have build for ourselves. Or, we are simply petrified to look at life’s facts as they are. And there is one simple fact that most of us are utterly scared to meditate, reflect on and face head on: We are going to die. Everyone around us is going to die.
            </p> 
            <p>  
                Such reminders and exercises take part of Memento Mori—the ancient practice of reflection on mortality that goes back to Socrates, who said that the proper practice of philosophy is “about nothing else but dying and being dead.” In early Buddhist texts, a prominent term is maraṇasati, which translates as ‘remember death.’ Some Sufis have been called the “people of the graves,” because of their practice of frequenting graveyards to ponder on death and one’s mortality.
            </p>  
            <p>Throughout history, Memento Mori reminders have come in many forms. Some, like the aide behind the general, were there to humble. Others were invented to inspire zest for life. The essayist Michel de Montaigne, for instance, was fond of an ancient Egyptian custom where during times of festivities, a skeleton would be brought out with people cheering “Drink and be merry for when you’re dead you will look like this.”</p>  
                
            <p>To us moderns this sounds like an awful idea. 
                Who wants to think about death? But what if instead of being scared and unwilling to embrace this truth we did the opposite? 
                What if reflecting and meditating on that fact was a simple key to living life to the fullest? 
                Or that it was the key to our freedom—as Montaigne put it, “To practice death is to practice freedom. 
                A man who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave.”</p>  
                
            <p>In his Meditations—essentially his own private journal—Marcus Aurelius wrote that “You could leave life right now. 
                Let that determine what you do and say and think.” 
                That was a personal reminder to continue living a life of virtue NOW, and not wait. 
                The French painter Philippe de Champaigne expressed a similar sentiment in his painting Still Life with a Skull, which showed the three essentials of existence — the tulip (life),
                 the skull (death), and the hourglass (time). 
                 The original painting is part of a genre referred to as Vanitas, 
                 a form of 17th century artwork featuring symbols of mortality which encourage reflection on the meaning and fleetingness of life.</p>    
                
            <p>Meditating on your mortality is only depressing if you miss the point. 
                It is in fact a tool to create priority and meaning. 
                It’s a tool that generations have used to create real perspective and urgency. 
                To treat our time as a gift and not waste it on the trivial and vain. Death doesn’t make life pointless but rather purposeful. 
                And fortunately, we don’t have to nearly die to tap into this. A simple reminder can bring us closer to living the life we want. 
                It doesn’t matter who you are or how many things you have left to be done, a car can hit you in an intersection and drive your teeth back into your skull. 
                That’s it. It could all be over. Today, tomorrow, someday soon.</p>   
                
            <p>The Stoic finds this thought invigorating and humbling. 
                It is not surprising that one of Seneca’s biographies is titled Dying Every Day. 
                After all, it is Seneca who urged us to tell ourselves “You may not wake up tomorrow,” when going to bed and “You may not sleep again,” when waking up as reminders of our mortality.
                Or as another Stoic, Epictetus, urged his students: 
                “Keep death and exile before your eyes each day, along with everything that seems terrible— by doing so, you’ll never have a base thought nor will you have excessive desire.”
                Use those reminders and meditate on them daily—let them be the building blocks of living your life to the fullest and not wasting a second</p>

                <h2>What is stoicism?</h2>
                <h5>Dec 6, 2020</h5>
                <img src="../actualSite/img/Marcus-Aurelius.jpg" alt="Marcus">
            
        
            <p>
            Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. 
            It is a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. 
            According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to eudaimonia (happiness, or blessedness) is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself,
            by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or by the fear of pain, by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is the only good" for human beings, and those external things—such as health, wealth, 
            and pleasure—are not good or bad in themselves (adiaphora), but have value as "material for virtue to act upon." 
            Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics. The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is "in accordance with nature." Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.
            Many Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized that because "virtue is sufficient for happiness," a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune.
            This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm," though the phrase does not include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.
            Stoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. 
            It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD.
            Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism).
